Notice, the LEGO dataset has 16 classes. And since its dataset contains less images than cifar10 or minist, the number of users need to be small, or there will be an error.

The dataset can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joosthazelzet/lego-brick-images
After unzipping the file, move the folder 'LEGO brick images v1' under path '\Federated-Learning-PyTorch-master\Federated-Learning-PyTorch-master\data'
